Some quick tips

| Stage        | Target           | Results     | Analysis  | 
| :------------- |:-------------|:-------------|:------|
| Set up   | <ul><li>Get the set-up right</li><li>Set Transforms</li><li>Set Data Loader</li><li>Set Basic Working Code</li><li>Set Basic Training  & Test Loop</li></ul> | <ul><li>Parameters: 6.3M</li><li>Best Training Accuracy: 99.99</li><li>Best Test Accuracy: 99.24</li></ul>|<ul><li>Extremely Heavy Model for such a problem</li><li>Model is over-fitting, but we are changing our model in the next step</li></ul> | 
| Basic Skeleton  |<ul><li>Get the basic skeleton right. We will try and avoid changing this skeleton as much as possible. </li><li>No fancy stuff</li></ul>|<ul><li>Parameters: 194k</li><li>Best Train Accuracy: 99.35</li><li>Best Test Accuracy: 99.02</li>|<ul><li>The model is still large, but working. </li><li>We see some over-fitting</li>
| Lighter Model  |<ul><li>Make the model lighter</li></ul></ul>|<li>Parameters: 10.7k</li><li>Best Train Accuracy: 99.00</li><li>Best Test Accuracy: 98.98</li></ul>|<li>Good model!</li><li>No over-fitting, model is capable if pushed further</li></ul> 
| Batch Normalization  |<ul><li>Add Batch-norm to increase model efficiency.</li></ul>|<ul><li>Parameters: 10.9k</li><li>Best Train Accuracy: 99.9</li><li>Best Test Accuracy: 99.3</li>|<ul><li>We have started to see over-fitting now. </li><li>Even if the model is pushed further, it won't be able to get to 99.4</li></ul>
| Regularization  |<ul><li>Add Regularization, Dropout</li></ul>|<ul><li>Parameters: 10.9k</li><li>Best Train Accuracy: 99.39 (20th Epoch) & 99.47 (25th)</li><li>Best Train Accuracy: 99.30</li></ul>|<ul><li>Regularization working. </li><li>But with the current capacity, not possible to push it further. </li><li>We are also not using GAP, but depending on a BIG-sized kernel</li></ul>
| Global Average Pooling  |<ul><li>Add GAP and remove the last BIG kernel.</li></ul>|<ul><li>Parameters: 6k</li><li>Best Train Accuracy: 99.86</li><li>Best Test Accuracy: 98.13</li></ul>|<ul><li><span style="color:red">Adding Global Average Pooling reduces accuracy - WRONG</span></li><li>We are comparing a 10.9k model with 6k model. Since we have reduced model capacity, a reduction in performance is expected. </li></ul>
| Increasing Capacity  |<ul><li>Increase model capacity. Add more layers at the end. </li></ul>|<ul><li>Parameters: 11.9k</li><li>Best Train Accuracy: 99.33</li><li>Best Test Accuracy: 99.04</li></ul>|<ul><li>The model still showing over-fitting, possibly DropOut is not working as expected! Wait yes! We don't know which layer is causing over-fitting. Adding it to a specific layer wasn't a great idea. </li><li>Quite Possibly we need to add more capacity, especially at the end. </li><li>Closer analysis of MNIST can also reveal that just at RF of 5x5 we start to see patterns forming. </li><li>We can also increase the capacity of the model by adding a layer after GAP!</li></ul>
| Correct MaxPooling Location  |<ul><li>Increase model capacity at the end (add layer after GAP)</li><li>Perform MaxPooling at RF=5</li><li>Fix DropOut, add it to each layer</li></ul>|<ul><li>Parameters: 13.8k</li><li>Best Train Accuracy: 99.39</li><li>Best Test Accuracy: 99.41 (9th Epoch)</li></ul>|<ul><li>Works!</li><li>But we're not seeing 99.4 or more as often as we'd like. We can further improve it. </li><li>The model is not over-fitting at all. </li><li>Seeing image samples, we can see that we can add slight rotation. </li></ul>
| Image Augmentation  |<ul><li>Add rotation, our guess is that 5-7 degrees should be sufficient. </li></ul>|<ul><li>Parameters: 13.8k</li><li>Best Train Accuracy: 99.15</li><li>Best Test Accuracy: 99.5 (18th Epoch)</li></ul>|<ul><li>The model is under-fitting now. This is fine, as we know we have made our train data harder. </li><li>The test accuracy is also up, which means our test data had few images which had transformation difference w.r.t. train dataset</li></ul>
| Playing naively with Learning Rates  |<ul><li>Add LR Scheduler</li></ul>|<ul><li>Parameters: 13.8k</li><li>Best Train Accuracy: 99.21</li><li>Best Test Accuracy: 99.45 (9th Epoch), 99.48 (20th Epoch)</li></ul>|<ul><li>Finding a good LR schedule is hard. We have tried to make it effective by reducing LR by 10th after the 6th epoch.</li><li>It did help in getting to 99.4 or faster, but the final accuracy is not more than 99.5. Possibly a good scheduler can do wonders here!</li></ul>
